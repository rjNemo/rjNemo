# <center>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Ruidy</center>

## <center>Full-Stack Software Engineer</center>

You can find me on  [![LinkedIn][1.1]][1]

### ðŸ˜„ Who I Am 

PhD in Physics (Sorbonnes UniversitÃ©, Paris) living in Hamburg (Germany).

I am obsessed with first-principles such as: 
- Test-Driven Development, 
- Domain-Driven Design, 
- Clean Code,
- Clean Architecture.

### ðŸ’¬ What I do

My main languages are: 
- Python 3, 
- React (mostly TypeScript)
- Go. 

I have used these to successfully scale applications to million of concurrent users.

I consider programming languages as tools and love to learn as much as possible. 

ðŸŒ± At the moment, I am very interested in Rust and Elixir.
